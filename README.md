# Simple-Embed

Simple-Embed is a package that provides sentence or document embeddings for a given text file. The package also facilitates a generalized functionality of fine-tuning of pre-trained models over problem-specific data. The package currently includes support for almost all of the hugging face transformers along with 4 other non-transformer-based sentence embedding techniques.
